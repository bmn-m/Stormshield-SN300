# Stormshield-SN300
Stormshield SN300 OPNSense 

A nice colleague of mine gave me a Stormshield SN300 a few days ago. 
Since I am a big OPNSense fan, I wanted to install the same on the Stormshield. 
Here and in some YouTube videos, I summarize briefly what was necessary and whether it was worth it.

It should also be mentioned that Stormshield is a Subsidiary of Airbus Defense & Space Cyber Programmes.
